"""Main module to read Bunkr URLs from a file, and download from them.

This module manages the entire download process by leveraging asynchronous operations,
allowing for efficient handling of multiple URLs.

Usage:
    To run the module, execute the script directly. It will process URLs listed in
    'URLs.txt' and log the session activities in 'session_log.txt'.
