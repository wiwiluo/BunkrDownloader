"""Thread-safe token-bucket rate limiter for capping aggregate download speed.

A single RateLimiter instance is shared across every download thread (all
chunks of all files in the current run), so --rate-limit caps the *total*
bandwidth used by the process — not a per-connection or per-file limit that
would be trivially multiplied by --connections or concurrent album items.
